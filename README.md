This is the updated version of my Scramble Songs game! 
Built with NextJS and Deployed to Vercel!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

A Youtube API Key is required to get access to the Jingle Jumble playlist.
The environment variable must be named as follows:
`YT_API_KEY=<some-api_key`
`YT_PAGE_RESULTS_NUM=<some int>`
`YT_PLAYLIST_ID=<youtube playlist id>`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
